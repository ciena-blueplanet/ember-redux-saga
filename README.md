## Polyfill

In order to use [generator functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*) in your Ember application you need to make sure you do one of the following:

1. **Include Babel Polyfills** –  In order to include Babel polyfills add the following to your *ember-cli-build.js* configuration:

    ```js
    'ember-cli-babel': {
      includePolyfill: true
    }
    ```

2. **Add a Polyfill** – Add a polyfill by simply running the following command:

    ```bash
    ember install ember-maybe-import-regenerator
    ```
